Applications :
==============>>>

-> Number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys.
-> Number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3, possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
-> Number of ways a convex polygon of n+2 sides can split into triangles by connecting vertices.
-> Number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
-> Number of different Unlabeled Binary Trees can be there with n nodes.

Recursive Solution 
Catalan numbers satisfy the following recursive formula. 

C(0) = 1  and C(n+1) = sum(i=0  to n) C(i)*C(n-i) for  n>=0       

Solution 1.)
============>>>

def catalan(n):
    # Base Case
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
 
    # Catalan(n) is the sum
    # of catalan(i)*catalan(n-i-1)
    res = 0
    for i in range(n):
        res += catalan(i) * catalan(n-i-1)
 
    return res
    
Solution 2.)
============>>>

def catalan(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1):
        return 1

    catalan =[0]*(n+1)

    catalan[0] = 1
    catalan[1] = 1
 
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            catalan[i] += catalan[j]* catalan[i-j-1]

    return catalan[n]
